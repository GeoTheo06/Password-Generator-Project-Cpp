# Password-Generator-Project-Cpp

## Description
PassGen 2.0 is a password generator program written in C++. It allows users to generate passwords with varying levels of complexity. The program provides two options for generating passwords: easy-to-remember passwords (weak) and actually random passwords (strong).

* The "easy-to-remember" passwords generated by PassGen 2.0 are designed to be simple and memorable. They consist of a combination of consonants, vowels, special characters, and numbers. This option is suitable for situations where a password needs to be easily remembered but may not provide the highest level of security.

* The "actually random" passwords generated by PassGen 2.0 are more complex and offer a higher level of security. They are generated using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. This option is suitable for situations where a strong and secure password is required.

## How to Set Up and Run
To run PassGen 2.0, follow these steps:
* Download the executable file
* Run it.
* Upon running the program, you will be prompted with a menu to choose the type of password you want to generate. Enter the corresponding number for your choice and follow the on-screen instructions to enter the desired password size. The program will then generate the password and display it on the console.
